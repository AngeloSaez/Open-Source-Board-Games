# Open-Source-Board-Games

# Message from author

I made a series of board games over the summer of 2022. These original ideas were by me but I ran a thorough round of playtesting with both my friends and family. After each session, the game was critiqued and improved.  Previously, I was the designer, composer, and artist. But now, the game is in the public's hands. I encourage artists to create prettier assets. I encourage musicians to create prettier songs. And I encourage designers to expand the game in their own way.   

Looking forward to playing your versions,

# Well, what now?

Click through the repository to see the assets and read the rules. Check out the videos I made if you want a quick lesson on how to play. If you are interested in playig the game, feel free on following the "blueprints" outlined in the repository to make your on versions at home. If you are an artist/composer feel free to take a look at the art/songs of the game and make your own versions!

All in all, I want people to make their own copies of the game at home and try challenging themselves by thinking what other ways they would like to see the game to be made. I really hope to someday see versions made by other people :-)

# Boat game -- authors notes

For this game, I wanted to make what I saw as a traditional board game. It was fun using a physical medium for game prototyping because it was surprisingly forgiving about mistakes. The development of this game was very exciting and I this one quickly became my favorite of the two projects because of the atmosphere I was able to create for it using the music I made and the environment I designed.

# Plant game  -- authors notes

This game was fun to make. I wanted this game to be a lot more of a lightweight game than the boat game. I also wanted the concepts to be as different as possible. Having this project be so different from my other one made it exciting to switch between them whenever I got bored of working on one for a while. This was one of those games where all my friends were better at playing it than I were. Games with my friends devolved into feirce head to head mind games between two friends while I dawdled in the corner overbidding for an item nobody wanted.
