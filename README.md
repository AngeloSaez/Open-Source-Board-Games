# Open-Source-Board-Games
I made a series of board games over the summer of 2022. These original ideas were by me but I ran a thorough round of playtesting with both my friends and family. After each session, the game was critiqued and improved.  Previously, I was the designer, composer, and artist. But now, the game is in the public's hands. I encourage artists to create prettier assets. I encourage musicians to create prettier songs. And I encourage designers to expand the game in their own way.   

Looking forward to playing your versions,

# Boat game

For this game, I wanted to make what I saw as a traditional board game. It was fun using a physical medium for game prototyping because it was surprisingly forgiving about mistakes. The development of this game was very exciting and I this one quickly became my favorite of the two projects because of the atmosphere I was able to create for it using the music I made and the environment I designed.

# Plant game

This game was fun to make. I wanted this game to be a lot more of a lightweight game than the boat game. I also wanted the concepts to be as different as possible. Having this project be so different from my other one made it exciting to switch between them whenever I got bored of working on one for a while. This was one of those games where all my friends were better at playing it than I were. Games with my friends devolved into feirce head to head mind games between two friends while I dawdled in the corner overbidding for an item nobody wanted.
